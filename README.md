# Resume Job Matcher

A FastAPI-based backend service that evaluates how well a resume matches a job description using:

* keyword skill matching
* semantic similarity using transformer embeddings
* skill gap analysis

The API extracts skills from resumes and job descriptions, computes a match score, and highlights missing requirements.

This project demonstrates backend API development, NLP integration, testing, CI pipelines, and clean Python project structure.

# API Usage

## Match resume text

POST `/match`

Example request

```json
{
  "resume_text": "Python developer with FastAPI, SQL, and Docker experience",
  "job_description": "Looking for a backend engineer with Python, FastAPI, SQL, Docker, AWS and Kubernetes"
}
```

Example response

```json
{
  "overall_score": 78.7,
  "matched_skills": ["aws", "docker", "fastapi", "python", "sql"],
  "missing_skills": ["kubernetes"],
  "resume_keywords": ["aws", "docker", "fastapi", "python", "rest api", "sql"],
  "jd_keywords": ["aws", "docker", "fastapi", "kubernetes", "python", "sql"],
  "explanation": "This is a strong match. Matched skills: aws, docker, fastapi, python, sql. Missing skills: kubernetes."
}
```

---

## Upload resume file

POST `/match-upload`

Supports:

* PDF resumes

Example form data

```
resume_file: resume.pdf
job_description: Backend engineer with Python and FastAPI
```

---

# Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

---

# Code Quality

Formatting

```bash
black .
```

Linting

```bash
ruff check .
```

---

# Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions automatically runs on every push and pull request.

The pipeline performs:

* dependency installation
* code formatting checks
* lint checks
* test execution

---

# Future Improvements

Possible enhancements:

* DOCX resume support
* resume section analysis
* better skill extraction using NLP
* web frontend
* containerization with Docker
* deployment to cloud platforms
